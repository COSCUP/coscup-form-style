The COSCUP Form Style
=====================

This project is for unifying the form style for Google Docs Form used in COSCUP.

In COSCUP, we often use Google Docs for collecting information from others.
For better corporate identity (CI), we made this stuffs to **hack** the form.

Currently, we made these changes to the form:

- Set the background color of body
- Add a banner with coscup2012 logo at the top of heading
- Round the corner of container and the banner
- Center the title
- Change the text color
- Add favicon of coscup


Guide of Usage
--------------

We support Linux and MacOSX currently.
We welcome anyone contributes this *tiny* project on any part, e.g. Windows support. (haha)

Follow these steps:

1. Clone this project into your machine. You may need ability of using git.
2. Run the script `auto-gform.sh`. It has an *ugly* usage tutorial if you don't pass argument to it.
3. Put the stored page onto any web server. We have used Dropbox for this purpose. The Dropbox public folder is available to let you put your webpage publicly.

Notes

- I cannot find other ways to use github as a CDN, so I use github pages.
- I think there would be no other one contributes on this project. XD
